## Outline

1. Quick poll
2. What you'll get out of this session
3. Why choo?
4. Dependencies
5. Your first app

## Quick poll

1. Software devs?
2. Built an app in JS?
3. Used react or redux?

---
## What you'll get out of this session

- Build a basic todo app in a modern, functional front-end framework
- We'll cover 90% of the library's footprint
- The whole workshop is written down so you can pick it up later

---
## Why choo?

```javascript
const choo = require('choo')
const html = require('choo/html')
const app = choo()

app.model({
  state: { title: 'Not quite set yet' },
  reducers: {
    update: (data, state) => ({ title: data })
  }
})

const mainView = (state, prev, send) => html`
  <main>
    <h1>Title: ${state.title}</h1>
    <input
      type="text"
      oninput=${(e) => send('update', e.target.value)}>
  </main>
`

app.router((route) => [
  route('/', mainView)
])

const tree = app.start()
document.body.appendChild(tree)
```

---
## Why choo?

- 5kb
- FUNctional (transparent side effects, immutable, uni-directional data flow)
- Small api footprint (easy to remember)
- Minimal tooling
- Just JavaScript

---
## Assumptions

- You have NodeJS w/npm
- Concept of **models** and **views** (as in MVC)
- Okay with a couple new ES6 features (const, arrow functions, template strings)

### Backup plan

But write this down:

```bash
budo index.js --port $PORT
```
